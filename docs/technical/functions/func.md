# Overview

This section provides an explanation of key functions, classes, and resource functions used in the project. It will be divided into two main sections: **Resources** and **View Models**.

## Resources

The **Resources** section covers reusable components and utilities that facilitate common tasks and operations across the application. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **UI Models**: Definitions and implementations of user interface models that are used throughout the application to maintain consistency and promote reuse.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Tools and techniques for managing asynchronous operations, multi-threading, and concurrent tasks to ensure smooth and efficient performance.

## View Models

The **View Models** section focuses on the components responsible for managing and preparing data for display in the user interface. This includes:

- **Data Binding**: Mechanisms for linking data sources with UI components to ensure that the user interface reflects the current state of the data.
- **State Management**: Techniques for managing the state of the application and handling user interactions to provide a responsive and intuitive user experience.
