# Overview

Here's an improved version for technical documentation:

We are utilizing Firebase services under the free tier plan, which comes with certain usage limitations. To stay within these limits, it is essential to implement several measures. For instance, optimizing image and data sizes to reduce consumption, minimizing daily request volumes, and so on.

## FirebaseManager Class

The `FirebaseManager` class provides a centralized management of Firebase services for authentication, cloud storage, real-time database, and Firestore within an iOS application built using SwiftUI. This documentation explains the structure of the class, its initialization, and the Firebase services it manages.

### Dependencies

To use `FirebaseManager`, ensure the following Firebase modules are integrated into your project using CocoaPods or manually:
- Firebase
- FirebaseDatabase
- FirebaseFirestore
- FirebaseStorage

### Class Structure

#### Properties

- **auth**: Manages authentication operations using Firebase Authentication.
- **storage**: Provides access to Firebase Cloud Storage for storing user-generated content such as photos and videos.
- **firestore**: Offers a NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development.
- **database**: Provides access to Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization and data persistence.


The `shared` static constant ensures that there is only one instance (`FirebaseManager`) throughout the application, promoting a unified access point to Firebase services.

The `init()` method initializes Firebase services if they haven't been configured (`FirebaseApp.configure()`). It sets up:
- **auth**: Authentication service.
- **storage**: Cloud Storage service.
- **firestore**: Firestore service.
- **database**: Realtime Database service.


#### Conclusion

The `FirebaseManager` class simplifies integration and management of Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database, and Storage) within SwiftUI-based iOS applications. By utilizing the shared instance and following Firebase best practices, you can enhance security, scalability, and efficiency in your application.

You can access Firebase services through the shared instance of `FirebaseManager`.
