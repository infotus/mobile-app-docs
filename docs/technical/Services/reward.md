### Ways to Earn Rewards

There are three ways for users to earn rewards:

1. **Daily Consecutive Login Rewards**: Users receive rewards for logging in consecutively each day. Missing a day resets the consecutive login count in Firebase Firestore. The rewards for each day are:
    - Day 1: 25 experience points (exp) and shopping points
    - Day 2: A random font color
    - Day 3: 50 exp and shopping points
    - Day 4: A random background color
    - Day 5: 100 exp and shopping points
    - Day 6: 1-day exp multiplier
    - Day 7: 50 cheer coins

2. **Daily Mission Rewards**: There are 7 daily missions (tasks) that users can complete to earn exp points and Shopping points. It's important to collect points promptly after completing each mission, as points do not accumulate if not collected. The missions include:
    - Comment once in chat
    - Watch a live-stream 
    - Follow a streamer
    - Send a gift to a streamer
    - Share the app
    - Start a live-stream
    - Purchase cheer coins

   Each mission offers different rewards and points.

3. **Level Rewards**: Users automatically level up when they accumulate enough points. The rewards for reaching specific levels are:
    - Level 2: Option to hide or show the level logo in chat
    - Level 5: A random item from the item shop
    - Level 10: Exp multiplier for 3 days
    - Level 15: A random UI skin
    - Level 20: A random font style
    - Level 25: A random emoji package
    - Level 30: A random animated emoji package
